            "Alex is a driven and intelligent student from a suburban background, known for being tech-savvy and highly organized – *or at least, trying to be*. They came to college with big dreams of making an impact in the tech world. Alex is academically strong, loves problem-solving, and enjoys collaborating on projects. They are reasonably social, having a core group of friends, but often feel torn between their academic responsibilities, club commitments (President of the university's AI & Robotics Club), and a desire to maintain a healthy social life and personal well-being. Alex lives on campus in a shared apartment.\n",

            "1.  **Academic Excellence:** Maintain a high GPA, excel in challenging CS courses, and secure a strong internship for the upcoming summer.\n",
            "2.  **Career Development:** Build a robust portfolio of projects, network with industry professionals, and stay updated on tech trends.\n",
            "3.  **Effective Time Management:** Balance demanding coursework, club leadership, personal projects, and social activities without feeling constantly overwhelmed.\n",
            "4.  **Personal Well-being:** Get enough sleep, eat healthily, make time for exercise, and reduce overall stress and anxiety.\n",
            "5.  **Stay Connected & Informed:** Keep up with campus events, workshops, and social gatherings without constant FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out).\n",
            "6.  **Optimize Learning:** Find efficient ways to study, retain information, and collaborate with peers on group assignments.\n",

            "1.  **Information Overload:** Juggling multiple platforms for assignments (LMS, Piazza), club communications (Discord, email), personal calendar (Google Calendar), and social plans (GroupMe, Instagram). It's hard to get a unified view of their day/week.\n",
            "2.  **\"Death by a Thousand Emails\":** Their university email inbox is a constant flood of announcements, deadlines, club updates, and spam, making it difficult to prioritize important messages.\n",
            "3.  **Procrastination & Deadlines:** Despite being organized, the sheer volume of tasks sometimes leads to paralysis by analysis, resulting in last-minute rushes and stress before deadlines.\n",
            "4.  **Missed Opportunities:** Hearing about cool workshops, career fairs, or social events *after* they've already happened because the information was buried in an email or a post they didn't see.\n",
            "5.  **Difficulty Prioritizing:** With multiple projects and commitments, it's hard to objectively decide what needs immediate attention versus what can wait, leading to inefficient work habits.\n",
            "6.  **Lack of Integrated Planning:** Their current tools (physical planner, Google Calendar, Notion for notes, Todoist for tasks) don't \"talk\" to each other, requiring manual entry and cross-referencing.\n",
            "7.  **Maintaining Work-Life Balance:** The constant pressure to succeed often means sacrificing sleep or social plans, leading to burnout. They want to be more intentional about scheduling downtime.\n",
            "8.  **Finding Study Buddies/Collaborators:** While active in clubs, sometimes it's hard to quickly find other students in their specific classes who want to work together on challenging assignments or prep for exams.\n",

            "*   **Communication:** Prefers quick texts and DMs for social, but relies on email for formal university communications (though struggles with its volume).\n",
            "*   **Learning Style:** Visual learner, benefits from structured schedules and checklists.\n",

            "    *   **Meets:** Effective Time Management, Stay Connected & Informed.\n",

            "    *   **Description:** An intelligent system that not only lists tasks from all integrated sources but also suggests priorities based on deadlines, estimated effort (user-inputted or AI-learned), course difficulty, and Alex's current schedule. It would provide proactive reminders, allow for breaking down large projects into smaller steps, and offer \"focus mode\" timers (e.g., Pomodoro) to combat procrastination and maintain momentum.\n",

            "    *   **Description:** A smart feed that learns Alex's major, minor, club affiliations, and interests to proactively recommend relevant workshops, career fairs, internships, hackathons, guest lectures, and social campus events. It would pull information from university event calendars, career services, and industry news, ensuring Alex doesn't miss out on valuable academic, career, or social opportunities that were previously buried in emails or obscure platforms.\n",

            "    *   **Description:** A feature allowing Alex to easily connect with other students in their specific courses or clubs. This would facilitate forming study groups, finding project collaborators, and asking/answering questions about assignments. It could include private and public chat channels for classes, shared document editing capabilities, and a simple \"find a study buddy for [Course Name]\" function.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Work-Life Balance & Well-being Toolkit:**\n",
            "    *   **Solves:** Maintaining Work-Life Balance, overall stress/anxiety.\n",
            "    *   **Meets:** Personal Well-being, Effective Time Management.\n",
            "    *   **Description:** Tools within the app to help Alex intentionally schedule downtime and track well-being. This could include a \"smart break scheduler\" that suggests short breaks between tasks, a gentle reminder to log off or prepare for sleep based on their calendar, simple habit tracking for exercise/meals, and potentially integration with sleep/fitness trackers (Apple Watch) to provide a holistic view and encourage healthier habits.\n",
